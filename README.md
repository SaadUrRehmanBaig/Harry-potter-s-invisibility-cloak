# Harry-potters-invisibility-cloak
This is simply a program that uses color segmentation and a bit of image processing to replace the foreground object of interest with the background.
You can take a unicolor bedsheet and apply color segmentation on it. After that take a picture of the background and place the bedsheet over yourself to virtually disappear, or make some part of your body disappear.

# Dependencies:
